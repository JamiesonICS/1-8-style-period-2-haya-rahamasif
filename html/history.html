            <p class="text">Although TTC spent lots of time in OddFuture, he decided to put his efforts into his own idndividual creations since his current musical group was blossoming. Tyler released his first solo song, "Bastard" around Christmas time in 2009 and showed a glimpse of Tyler's dark, cynical side through its violent lyrics and dystopian energy.</p>
            <p class="text">2011 saw Tyler drop Goblin, his second album widely agreed as his breakthrough, pushing the boundaries of what rap can be and once again showcasing his otherworldly talent and creativity. Gradually through the album Tyler descends into a deeper, darker, murderous energy, talking on killing all of his OF friends in his dirty imagination. These dark beginnings are a necessity to revisit when considering the California rapper’s development and rise to stardom. </p>
            <p class="text">“WOLF” released in 2013, with the record narrating an intricate love triangle between three characters. Alongside this, he exposes many thoughts on the negatives attached to fame and stardom. This album, while talking about extremely dark feelings and internal conflicts, manages to include more silly humor and energy we all know and love Tyler for these days. </p>
            <p class="text">A couple years later, Tyler dropped “Cherry Bomb”, which was the first time he showcased a gentle, soft sound style with feel-good lyrics. While this is a glimpse into what we see in 2021, Tyler’s fandom at the time received the album with huge criticism, calling the project immature, cheerful and fake. In typical fashion, Tyler refused to apologise to these fans, saying that Cherry Bomb was his favorite album yet. </p>
