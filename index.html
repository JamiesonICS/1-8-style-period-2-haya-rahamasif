    <h1>Tyler The Creator</h1>
    <h2 >One of my favorite Artists</h2>

    <h3 >Why I like his music</h3>
    <p >I like his music for 3 main reasons:</p>
    <ul >
        <li>His music is a mix of many genres, including: RnB, rap, jazz, pop and pop, which are some of my favorite genres. He has different styles that he experiments with with gives him a certain uniqueness and variety, which I like.</li>
        <li>His lyrics are relatble and poetic. He uses a lot of cool metaphors for life experiences and uses a lot of wordplay which I think is a difficult thing to incorporate into a song, making him all the more talented</li>
        <li>His music just slaps..like it really connects with human emotion through unique beats and sounds. For example, in his most popular album IGOR, he creates song that follow the cycle of love, describing his own feelings and issues through bangers, like heartbreak, jealousy, etc.. Each song covers a different event that occurs in TTC's life; he creates a story which you can follow through in the album.</li>
    </ul>
